README about me
Hello Odin! 

  I'm a stay-at-home dad and former automotive technician. I've been around computers since I was a child (back in the 80's) and have always been interested about the behind the scenes. I've been building, fixing, creating, updating, etc on anything and everything for most of my life. Whether its been replacing head gaskets, building a guitar, wiring circuits, creating, plumbing, or messing with computers, I just enjoy the learning curve and becoming proficient in any given area.
